As UIVeri5 is now deprecated, WDI5 is designed to run cross-platform end-to-end tests on a UI5 application, with selectors compatible to OPA5 as well. 
Think of WDI5 as an extension of the Webdriver.IO (Plugin) service that utilizes UI5's test API as well.   
In general, our new testing framework WDI5 = UI5 Test API + Webdriver.IO
