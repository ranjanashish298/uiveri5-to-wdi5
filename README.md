## Testing Framework: WDI5

As **UIVeri5** is now deprecated, **WDI5** has been designed as a robust solution for running cross-platform end-to-end tests on UI5 applications. WDI5 extends the functionalities of the [Webdriver.IO](https://webdriver.io/) service, making use of UI5's Test API for enhanced testing capabilities.

### Key Features:
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Run your tests across different platforms seamlessly.
- **OPA5 Compatible Selectors:** Use selectors compatible with OPA5 for an integrated testing experience.
- **Integration with Webdriver.IO Plugin:** Leverages the power of Webdriver.IOâ€™s plugin system.

### Concept Overview:
Think of WDI5 as combining the strengths of `UI5 Test API` and `Webdriver.IO` to form a comprehensive testing framework.

**WDI5 = UI5 Test API + Webdriver.IO**
